Summary:
We are conducting an analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States, utilizing various datasets related to socioeconomic factors, racial demographics, and details of police-involved fatalities. The analysis involves data exploration, visualization, and interpretation to gain insights into factors such as poverty rates, high school graduation rates, racial demographics, armed status of victims, age distribution, mental illness prevalence, geographical distribution of incidents, and trends over time.

Description:

Data Loading and Exploration:
We begin by loading several datasets containing information on median household income, poverty rates, high school graduation rates, racial demographics by city, and details of police-involved fatalities.
The data is explored to understand its shape, column names, presence of NaN values, and duplicates.
Data Cleaning:
No significant cleaning is required as per the provided information.
Visualization and Analysis:
We visualize the poverty rate in each US state, high school graduation rate by city, relationship between poverty rates and high school graduation rates, and racial makeup by city using bar charts and scatter plots.
Other visualizations include donut charts showing the racial distribution of people killed by police, bar charts comparing the total number of deaths by gender, box plots illustrating the age and manner of death by gender, and histograms showing the age distribution of people killed by police.
We also analyze the prevalence of mental illness among people killed by police and examine armed status and race distribution using bar plots.
Geographical analysis is performed using choropleth maps to visualize police killings by US state and top 10 cities with the most police killings.
Additionally, we analyze the rate of death by race in the top 10 cities and explore the trend of police killings over time using a line plot.
Insights and Interpretation:
Through these visualizations and analyses, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and disparities in fatal police shootings across various demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Insights gained from the analysis can help inform discussions and policy decisions aim
